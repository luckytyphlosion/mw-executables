Note: the DLLs in each revision folder for the DS compilers very likely originate from a single revision, based on the fact that 1.2/sp4 was supplied from an alternate source and `1.2/sp4/lmgr8c.dll`'s SHA1 is different from the `lmgr8c.dll`s in all the other folders. The DLLs are duplicated in each revision folder anyway for convenience. It is unknown if the DSI folder has this same issue.
